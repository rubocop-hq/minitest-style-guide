This Minitest style guide outlines the recommended best practices for real-world programmers to write code that can be maintained by other real-world programmers.

https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop[RuboCop], a static code analyzer (linter) and formatter, has a https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-minitest[`rubocop-minitest`] extension, provides a way to enforce the rules outlined in this guide.

You can generate a PDF copy of this guide using https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/[AsciiDoctor PDF], and an HTML copy https://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-documents/#converting-a-document-to-html[with] https://asciidoctor.org/#installation[AsciiDoctor] using the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
# Generates README.pdf
asciidoctor-pdf -a allow-uri-read README.adoc

# Generates README.html
asciidoctor
----

[TIP]
====
Install the `rouge` gem to get nice syntax highlighting in the generated document.

[source,shell]
----
gem install rouge
----
====

== Assertion

=== Assert Nil [[assert-nil]]

Use `assert_nil` if expecting `nil`.

[source,ruby]
----
# bad
assert_equal(nil, actual)

# good
assert_nil(actual)
----

== Contributing

The guide is still a work in progress - some guidelines are lacking examples, some guidelines don't have examples that illustrate them clearly enough.
Improving such guidelines is a great (and simple way) to help the Ruby community!

In due time these issues will (hopefully) be addressed - just keep them in mind for now.

Nothing written in this guide is set in stone.
It's our desire to work together with everyone interested in Ruby coding style, so that we could ultimately create a resource that will be beneficial to the entire Ruby community.

Feel free to open tickets or send pull requests with improvements.
Thanks in advance for your help!

You can also support the project (and RuboCop) with financial contributions via https://www.patreon.com/bbatsov[Patreon].

== Spread the Word

A community-driven style guide is of little use to a community that doesn't know about its existence.
Tweet about the guide, share it with your friends and colleagues.
Every comment, suggestion or opinion we get makes the guide just a little bit better.
And we want to have the best possible guide, don't we?
